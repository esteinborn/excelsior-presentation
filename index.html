					<p>With ITS, NYS is positioned to avoid that by collaborating our efforts into one project.</p>

					<ul>
						<li>This wasn't just any old day at the office — just me and a couple of coworkers shooting the breeze about what we might do with a site, "if only" we didn't have this restriction or that</li>
						<li>It felt a bit surreal having so many intelligent people bouncing around ideas all at once. I could barely keep up.</li>
						<li>We thought of how the ideal site would work</li>
						<li>We weren't burdened with limitations. The sky was the limit.</li>
						<li>We threw around every good idea with no thought about the consequences</li>

					It can help make RWD easier to manage and to allow you to quickly start your responsive sites and apps and get in the browser day 1.<br>
					You may not need to re-invent the wheel again.<br>
					I've got one last thing to talk about thats near and dear to my heart, and that is...

					The entire code base for Excelsior is hosted on GitHub to download anytime<br>
					It's open-source and is appropriately licensed so that you are free to edit it in whatever way you like<br>
					I'm not gonna get into how to use GitHub today<br>
					I'll be giving an in-depth presentation on it next month.<br>
					But there are so many benefits of GitHub, and I'm going to tell you about two.

					I hope I've adequately stated Excelsior's Pre-Beta status<br>
					We still need testers, and testers need a way to file bug reports<br>
					GitHub Issues provide a super slick way for reporting bugs.<br>
					They are like forums for GitHub Projects where you can submit bugs to the project collaborators<br>
					You can also use them to ask questions, suggest enhancements, or raise awareness of issues that may not be specifically bug related.<br>
					Its as easy as clicking the "New Issue" button.

				<h2>Have Something to Add?</h2>
				<div class="fragment">Add support for legacy browsers?</div>
				<div class="fragment">Add a cool new feature that works great?</div>
				<div class="fragment">Contribute back, share your work with the world!<br>
				</div>
				<aside class="notes">
					The thing that excites me the most about GitHub is the collaboration it allows<br>
					Excelsior is yours just as much as it is ours.<br>
					We urge you to add new exciting features and contribute back to the project.<br>
					Did you build support for legacy browsers, or add a cool new feature?<br>
					You will never be shut out, the door is always open, all ideas and opinions can be discussed<br>
					If you contribute back, you will receive a pre-determined amount of high-fives and patted-backs based on its level of awesomeness.<br>
					If you add legacy browser support and it doesn't completely kill page performance, You will receive a hug :)
