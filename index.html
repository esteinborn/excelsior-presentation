              <p>As Luke was saying, we recently had the opportunity for a 3-week code sprint to tackle the problem of mobile and responsive web design.</p>
              <p>Normally that's a problem that many small teams will attempt to solve in isolation.</p>
              <p>However, there is a wide array of talent across New York, and with ITS we now have this amazing mechanism to bring all of that talent together and get things done.</p>
              <p>In other words, put a bunch of smart people in a room so they can get stuff done.</p>
              <p>And that's what we did.</p>

              <p>Navigation plays very differently roles in different contexts.</p>
              <p>When you have the large space of a widescreen monitor, you want it readily available so you can jump around the site as you please, but on a small screen you want it out the of way so you can focus on the task at hand.</p>
              <p><i>launch demo</i></p>
              <p>Here's a pretty standard navigation bar. It has some main categories and sub-categories. <i>show submenus</i></p>
              <p>I've got a resizer tool here <i>(mouse around it)</i> that can show us what it looks like at different sizes. Watch what happens when we go to the size of a typical tablet.</p>
              <p>click <strong>tablet</strong></p>
              <p>The menu is still there, but it's tucked out of the way. <i>click hamburger</i></p>
              <p>It's still just as functional. Even the sub-menus are here. <i>click Europe</i></p>
              <p>It works great at a smartphone size as well &mdash; <i>click phone</i></p>
              <p>In fact, <i>close menu</i> we put the menu icon on the right because statistics show most people hold their phones in their right hand, and this makes it easier for people to reach with their thumbs.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
          		<p>Let's take a look at an example of how a grid can reflow. <i>launch demo</i></p>
              <p>Now, for this demo I'm just using the basic outline of a grid. These boxes could contain any kind of content &mdash; text, images, buttons, and so on.</p>
              <p>These are two examples that take different approaches to responsiveness.</p>
              <p>At the top are three sections laid side-by-side and split into equal thirds.</p>
              <p>Down here, in red, we have a similar side-by-side layout. But lets assume that the content in these red areas can't get much narrower and still be usable.</p>
              <p>Let's see how these two arrangements react when we go down to the size of a tablet.</p>
              <p><i>click tablet</i></p>
              <p>Your eye was probably drawn to the red area where the pieces are now stacked vertically. This ensures each one has enough width for its content.</p>
              <p>But up here, the blue layout is no longer split into thirds. <i>mouse around right side</i> Because the content in this piece needs more width, it has actually expanded to take up half of the screen. Over on the left the pieces have been shrunk down to compensate.</p>
              <p>Let's take grids a step further.</p>
              <p><i>click 'Advanced' button</i></p>
              <p>Now we have two separate structures nested together. At this size, most of the pieces are stacked on top of each other and they're pretty symmetrical.</p>
              <p>Let's go back to a wider screen. <i>click desktop</i></p>
              <p>Now everything is side-by-side, all in one row. The pieces are using different proportions then before &mdash; they're no longer symmetrical. This is all the same HTML and the same content, it's just laid out differently to maintain legibility.</p>
              <p>The code behind this is not complex. It's the approach to your page's structure that requires some thought. You really have to take a moment to look at your content on different-sized screens to get a feel for what works best.</p>

              <p>Here we have some scientists and information about them. It's all important information, but for any given user some of it will be more important than the rest.</p>
              <p>So let's try and show as much data as possible, as long as it still fits. The summary column would be a good place to start since it takes so much room to display legibly.<i>click tablet</i></p>
              <p>So now the summary column is gone, which gives the rest of the data more room to breathe.</p>
              <p>And if the user wants to, they can still see the summary with this handy menu right above the table. <i>use menu to show summary</i></p>
              <p>This menu lets the user tell us what's important to them. <i>hide summary</i></p>
              <p>Let's go a bit further, all the way down to a smart phone size. <i>click phone</i></p>
              <p>Now we're left with 3 columns, because the data would be too squished if we showed more.</p>
              <p>These 3 columns were deemed more important by the page designer, who specified each column's importance in the page's HTML.</p>
              <p>Again, ultimately it's up to the user to decide what's useful, and if they want to they can always re-display columns and scroll around to view the content. <i>redisplay all columns and scroll around</i></p>
