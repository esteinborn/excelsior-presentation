					<p>My name is Craig Patik, and I'm from the Department of Tax and Finance.</p>
					<p><i>turn to Eric</i></p>
					<p>As Luke was saying, we recently had the opportunity for a 3-week code sprint to tackle the problem of mobile and responsive web design.</p>
					<p>Normally that's a problem that many small teams will attempt to solve in isolation.</p>
					<p>However, there is a wide array of talent across New York, and with ITS we now have this amazing mechanism to bring all of that talent together and get things done.</p>
					<p>In other words, put a bunch of smart people in a room so they can get stuff done.</p>
					<p>And that's what we did.</p>
					<p><i>next</i></p>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>The code sprint was quite an experience.</p>
					<p>It wasn't just any old day at the office. It wasn't just me and a couple of coworkers shooting the breeze about what we might do "if only" we didn't have this restriction or that obstacle.</p>
					<p>It felt a bit surreal having so many intelligent people bouncing around ideas all at once. At times I could barely keep up.</p>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p>The fundamental principle behind the best sites and services today is modularity and reusability</p>
					<p>With those concepts comes flexibility.</p>

					<p>But what about in two years? Three?</p>

				<h2>So We Started Making Stuff</h2>
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>We thought of components that are common to most web sites that aren't inherently flexibile.</p>
					<p>We redesigned them from the ground up and made them responsive and adaptable. I'd like to show you few now.</p>

				<h2>Navigation</h2>

					<a href="demos/navigation.html" target="_blank">View Demo</a>
				</div>
				<!-- <div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0"><img src="img/CropperCapture_11_.Gif" style=""></div> -->
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>Navigation plays very differently roles in different contexts.</p>
					<p>When you have the large space of a widescreen monitor, you want it readily available so you can jump around the site as you please, but on a small screen you want it out the of way so you can focus on the task at hand.</p>
					<p><i>launch demo</i></p>
					<p>Here's a pretty standard navigation bar. It has some main categories and sub-categories. <i>show submenus</i></p>
					<p>I've got a resizer tool here <i>(mouse around it)</i> that can show us what it looks like at different sizes. Watch what happens when we go to the size of a typical tablet.</p>
					<p>click <strong>tablet</strong></p>
					<p>The menu is still there, but it's tucked out of the way. <i>click hamburger</i></p>
					<p>It's still just as functional. Even the sub-menus are here. <i>click Europe</i></p>
					<p>It works great at a smartphone size as well &mdash; <i>click phone</i> &mdash; in fact, <i>close menu</i> we put the icon on the right because most people hold their phones in their right hand and this side is easier to reach with your thumb.</p>

				<h2>Responsive Grid</h2>
				<div>
					<a href="demos/grid.html" target="_blank">View Demo</a>
				</div>
				<!-- <div class="fragment" data-fragment-index="0"><img src="img/grid.gif" alt=""></div> -->
				<aside class="notes">
					<p>Next up: grids.</p>
					<p><i>launch demo</i></p>
					<p>Grids let us define a fluid layout for our components.</p>
					<p>A <em>responsive</em> grid takes it a step further &mdash; you can stack and reflow components in different configurations depending on how much room you have.</p>
					<p>Here we've got two examples: at the top are three sections of the page &mdash; they could contain anything: text, photos, or even a complex widget &mdash; and those are always going to remain side-by-side.</p>
					<p>But down here, in red, these pieces can't get much narrower and still be usable, so they're going re-stack. Just watch.</p>
					<p><i>click tablet</i></p>
					<p>Did you see that? Your eye was probably drawn to the red area where the pieces are now stacked vertically so make sure each has enough width.</p>
					<p>But up here in the blue area, it's no longer split into thirds. <i>mouse around right side</i> Because this piece out here needs more width, it's now taking up half of the screen, and over here on the left it's been shrunk down to just a sixth.</p>
					<p>Let's take it a step further. <i>click button</i> Again, remember that these boxes could contain anything, the colors are just for demonstration.</p>
					<p>Now we have two separate structures nested together &mdash; the green pieces are stacked, and the yellow pieces are split up in their own way.</p>
					<p>Let's go back to a wider screen. <i>click desktop</i></p>
					<p>Now everything is side-by-side, and the yellow pieces are using different proportions then before. This is all the same HTML and some very basic CSS. It's not the code that's complex, it's the approach to your page's structure that takes some thought. You really have to take a moment to look at your content on different-sized screens to get a feel for what works best.</p>
					<p>Let's move on to the last demo. <i>next</i></p>

				<aside class="notes">
					<p><i>bullet</i></p>
					<p>Let's think about how we can make all that data available everywhere. <i>open demo</i></p>
					<p>Here we have some scientists and information about them. It's all important information, but for any given user some of it will be more important than the rest.</p>
					<p>So let's try and show as much data as possible, as long as it still fits. The summary column would be a good place to start since it takes so much room to display legibly.<i>click tablet</i></p>
					<p>So now the summary column is gone, which gives the rest of the data more room to breathe.</p>
					<p>And if the user wants to, they can still see the summary with this handy menu right above the table. <i>use menu to show summary</i></p>
					<p>This menu lets the user tell us what's important to them. <i>hide summary</i></p>
					<p>Let's go a bit further, all the way down to a smart phone size. <i>click phone</i></p>
					<p>Now we're left with 3 columns, because the data would be too squished if we showed more.</p>
					<p>These 3 columns were deemed more important by the page designer, who specified them with classes in the HTML. Again, ultimately it's up to the user to decide what's useful, and if they want to they can always re-display columns and scroll around. <i>redisplay all columns and scroll around</i></p>
